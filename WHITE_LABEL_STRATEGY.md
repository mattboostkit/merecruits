## What You Need to Add for White Labelling

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Have Before Launch)

#### 1. Multi-Tenancy Architecture
**Current:** Single agency (ME Recruits)
**Needed:** Multiple agencies on one platform

**Technical Requirements:**
- Add `tenantId` to all database tables
- Subdomain routing (`acme-recruitment.yourplatform.com`)
- Custom domain support (`www.acme-recruitment.com`)
- Tenant isolation (Agency A can't see Agency B's data)

**Database Changes:**
```typescript
// Add to schema.ts
tenants: defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  subdomain: v.string(), // "acme-recruitment"
  customDomain: v.optional(v.string()), // "www.acme.com"
  logo: v.string(),
  primaryColor: v.string(), // Brand color
  secondaryColor: v.string(),
  contactEmail: v.string(),
  phone: v.string(),
  address: v.optional(v.string()),

  // Subscription
  plan: v.union(v.literal("STARTER"), v.literal("PROFESSIONAL"), v.literal("ENTERPRISE")),
  subscriptionStatus: v.union(v.literal("ACTIVE"), v.literal("TRIAL"), v.literal("SUSPENDED")),
  trialEndsAt: v.optional(v.number()),

  // Features enabled
  features: v.object({
    aiCvAnalysis: v.boolean(),
    unlimitedJobs: v.boolean(),
    customBranding: v.boolean(),
    apiAccess: v.boolean(),
  }),

  createdAt: v.number(),
})
.index("by_subdomain", ["subdomain"])
.index("by_domain", ["customDomain"])
```

**All Other Tables Need:**
```typescript
tenantId: v.id("tenants")
```

#### 2. Authentication & User Management
**Current:** No auth (anyone can access admin)
**Needed:** Proper user authentication

**Requirements:**
- User login/signup
- Role-based access (Admin, Recruiter, Viewer)
- Per-tenant user management
- Password reset
- 2FA (optional, but good for Enterprise tier)

**Suggested Stack:**
- **Clerk** (easiest, handles everything) - $25/mo + per-user
- **Auth0** (enterprise-grade) - more expensive
- **NextAuth.js** (free, self-hosted) - more work

#### 3. Onboarding & Setup Wizard
**Needed:** First-time setup flow

**Steps:**
1. Sign up for platform
2. Choose subdomain (`yourname.recruitflow.com`)
3. Upload logo

## Technical Architecture for Multi-Tenancy

### Subdomain Routing (Next.js)

```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const hostname = request.headers.get('host')
  const subdomain = hostname?.split('.')[0]

  // Skip for main marketing site
  if (subdomain === 'www' || subdomain === 'yourplatform') {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }

  // Pass subdomain to app as header
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)
  requestHeaders.set('x-tenant-subdomain', subdomain || '')

  return NextResponse.rewrite(
    new URL(request.url),
    { request: { headers: requestHeaders } }
  )
}
```

### Tenant Context Provider

```typescript
// context/TenantContext.tsx
'use client'

import { createContext, useContext } from 'react'
import { useQuery } from 'convex/react'
import { api } from 'convex/_generated/api'

const TenantContext = createContext(null)

export function TenantProvider({ children, subdomain }) {
  const tenant = useQuery(api.tenants.getBySubdomain, { subdomain })

  return (
    <TenantContext.Provider value={tenant}>
      {children}
    </TenantContext.Provider>
  )
}

export const useTenant = () => useContext(TenantContext)
```

### Branding Application

```typescript
// Use tenant's brand colors
const tenant = useTenant()

<Button style={{
  backgroundColor: tenant.primaryColor,
  '--primary': tenant.primaryColor
}}>
  Apply Now
</Button>
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Scalability**
   - Convex handles scaling automatically
   - Next.js on Vercel scales horizontally
   - OpenAI rate limits (cache results, batching)

2. **Data Security**
   - SOC 2 compliance (required for Enterprise)
   - Regular security audits
   - Penetration testing
   - GDPR compliance (data residency in UK/EU)

3. **Multi-Tenancy Bugs**
   - Thorough testing (prevent data leakage)
   - Row-level security in Convex
   - Automated tests for tenant isolation

### Business Risks

1. **Churn**
   - Annual contracts for discount
   - Customer success manager (Enterprise)
   - In-app NPS surveys
   - Exit interviews

2. **Competition**
   - Patent AI CV analysis approach (if novel)
   - Build moat with integrations
   - Strong customer relationships

3. **OpenAI Dependency**
   - Fallback to GPT-4 if GPT-5 issues
   - Consider fine-tuning own model (long-term)
   - Pricing buffer for API cost increases
