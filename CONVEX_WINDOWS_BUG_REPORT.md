# Convex Windows Infinite Loop Bug Report

## Issue Summary
`npx convex dev` enters an infinite "Filesystem changed during push, retrying..." loop on Windows despite successfully deploying functions.

## Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Convex Version**: 1.28.0
- **Node Version**: 18.x
- **Project**: Next.js 15.5.5 with TypeScript
- **Shell**: PowerShell

## Problem Description
After running `npx convex dev`, the deployment succeeds but immediately triggers another deployment due to detected filesystem changes in the `convex/_generated/` directory. This creates an infinite loop:

```
✔ 18:05:25 Convex functions ready! (4.5s)
Filesystem changed during push, retrying...
✔ 18:05:28 Convex functions ready! (3.48s)
Filesystem changed during push, retrying...
✔ 18:05:32 Convex functions ready! (3.44s)
Filesystem changed during push, retrying...
[continues indefinitely]
```

## Root Cause
The bundled file `convex/_generated/server.js` changes immediately after esbuild generates it. This appears to be related to Windows file system watchers detecting their own writes.

## Attempted Fixes (None Worked)

### 1. ESLint Ignore
Added to `eslint.config.mjs`:
```javascript
ignores: [
  "convex/_generated/**",
]
```

### 2. TypeScript Exclude
Added to `tsconfig.json`:
```json
"exclude": ["node_modules", "convex/_generated"]
```

### 3. Prettier Ignore
Created `.prettierignore`:
```
convex/_generated
```

### 4. Git Attributes
Created `.gitattributes`:
```
convex/_generated/* -text
```

### 5. Convex Ignore
Created `.convexignore`:
```
_generated/
```

### 6. Environment Variables
Tried various Chokidar settings:
```powershell
$env:CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING = "false"
$env:CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL = "1000"
$env:CONVEX_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS = "500"
```

## Impact
- ✅ Functions deploy successfully
- ✅ Database schema updates correctly
- ✅ Application works perfectly
- ❌ Annoying infinite loop in terminal
- ❌ Increased CPU usage from constant re-deployments
- ❌ Difficult to see actual error messages

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Use `convex deploy` instead of `convex dev`
```bash
npx convex deploy
```
Manually deploy after each change. Skips the file watcher entirely.

### Option 2: Accept the loop
The loop is harmless - functions are working correctly despite the retries.

### Option 3: Run in production only
Only use Convex dev deployment, don't run the local watcher.

## Expected Behavior
`npx convex dev` should:
1. Generate files in `convex/_generated/`
2. Deploy successfully
3. Wait quietly for actual source file changes
4. Not detect its own generated files as changes

## Actual Behavior
The tool detects its own generated files as filesystem changes and immediately triggers another deployment.

## Similar Issues
This appears to be a Windows-specific file system watcher issue, possibly related to:
- Windows file timestamps being less precise than Unix
- Windows file system events firing differently
- The way esbuild writes files on Windows
- Chokidar (the file watcher library) behavior on Windows

## Request
Could the Convex CLI:
1. Add a built-in debounce for `_generated` folder changes?
2. Ignore its own generated files by default?
3. Add a `--no-watch-generated` flag?
4. Improve Windows file watcher compatibility?

## Repository
Project: ME Recruits (recruitment website)
Framework: Next.js 15 + Convex + TypeScript

## Reproduction Steps
1. Create a Next.js 15 project on Windows
2. Install Convex: `npm install convex`
3. Initialize Convex: `npx convex dev`
4. Observe infinite loop starting immediately

**Note**: This issue does NOT prevent development or deployment. Functions work perfectly. It's purely a developer experience issue with the file watcher.
