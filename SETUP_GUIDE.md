## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

Your site is ready to deploy. Vercel will handle everything automatically.

```bash
# Already done for you:
git push origin master
```

Vercel will automatically:
- Build your Next.js app
- Deploy to production
- Give you a live URL

### Step 2: Deploy Convex Schema

```bash
# Run this to deploy your Convex functions:
npx convex deploy

# When prompted, select your production deployment
```

This pushes your database schema and all Convex functions to production.

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

#### In Convex Dashboard:
1. Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select your "merecruits" project
3. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
4. Add these variables:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
ADMIN_EMAIL=helen@merecruits.com
```

#### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your "merecruits" project
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
4. Add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-url.convex.cloud
```

(You can find your Convex URL in the Convex Dashboard)

### Step 4: Seed Your Database

```bash
# Run the seed mutation in Convex Dashboard:
# Go to Functions ‚Üí seed:seedData ‚Üí Run
```

Or use the Convex CLI:

```bash
npx convex run seed:seedData
```

This populates your database with:
- 10 real jobs
- 4 team members (Helen Barham, Isobel Colman, Melissa Staveley, Ellie Waterman)
- 2 sample news articles

### Step 5: Configure Resend Domain (Optional but Recommended)

For professional emails:

1. Go to Resend ‚Üí Domains
2. Add your domain: `merecruits.com`
3. Add DNS records (they'll give you instructions)
4. Verify domain
5. Update `from` email in `convex/cvUploads.ts` from `noreply@merecruits.com` to your verified domain

## ü§ñ AI CV Parsing

### How It Works:

When a candidate uploads their CV:

1. **File uploaded to Convex storage** (permanent URL)
2. **Database record created** with candidate info
3. **AI parsing scheduled** (runs in background)
4. **GPT-4o-mini extracts:**
   - Professional summary
   - Key skills
   - Work experience (last 3 roles)
   - Education
   - Years of experience

### View Parsed Data:

Go to **Admin ‚Üí CV Submissions** and you'll see:
- "AI Analysis" section with summary and skills
- Years of experience badge
- Skills tags

### To Enable AI Parsing:

1. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Convex environment variables
2. That's it! Next CV uploaded will be automatically parsed

### Manual Parsing:

You can also manually parse a CV:

```javascript
// In Convex Dashboard ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí aiCVParser:parseAndAnalyzeCV
{
  "storageId": "<storage_id_from_cv_record>",
  "fileName": "john-doe-cv.pdf"
}
```

---

## üìß Email Notifications

### What Gets Sent:

**When a CV is submitted:**

1. **Admin Email:**
   - Subject: "New CV Submission: [Name]"
   - Contains: Name, email, job reference
   - Link to Convex Dashboard

2. **Candidate Email:**
   - Subject: "CV Received - ME Recruits"
   - Confirmation message
   - Professional branded email

### To Enable Emails:

1. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Convex environment variables
2. Update `convex/cvUploads.ts` line 57:
   - Uncomment the `ctx.scheduler.runAfter` block
3. Redeploy Convex: `npx convex deploy`

### Customize Email Templates:

Edit `convex/cvUploads.ts` in the `sendNotifications` action:

```typescript
// Line 93 - Admin email template
html: `
  <h2>New CV Submission</h2>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> ${args.applicantName}</p>
  ...
`,

// Line 108 - Candidate email template
html: `
  <h2>Thank You for Your Application</h2>
  <p>Dear ${args.applicantName},</p>
  ...
`,
```

## üîí Admin Panel Security

### Current Status:
The admin panel (`/admin`) is **publicly accessible** (no authentication).

### To Add Authentication:

**Option 1: Simple Password Protection (Quick)**

Use Vercel's built-in password protection:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Deployment Protection
2. Enable "Password Protection"
3. Set password

**Option 2: Proper Authentication (Recommended)**

Add Clerk or NextAuth:

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

Then wrap admin routes with authentication.

**For Now:** The admin panel is functional but not protected. Since this is internal use only, you can add auth later.
