        content: `## The Purpose of Your CV

Your CV has one primary purpose: to secure you an interview. It's not a comprehensive biography â€“ it's a targeted marketing document that demonstrates why you're the ideal candidate for the specific role you're applying for.

## Essential CV Structure

### Personal Details
Keep it simple: name, phone number, email address, and location (town/city only). There's no need to include your full address, date of birth, or photograph unless specifically requested.

### Professional Profile
Start with a concise 3-4 line professional profile that summarises who you are, your key strengths, and what you're looking for. Tailor this section for each application.

### Key Skills
Bullet point 6-8 relevant skills that match the job requirements. Include both technical skills and soft skills.

### Professional Experience
List your roles in reverse chronological order. For each position include:
- Job title, company name, and employment dates
- Brief context about the company/department
- 3-5 bullet points highlighting key achievements
- Quantifiable results where possible

## Common CV Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Generic Content** - Customise your CV for each role
2. **Too Long or Too Short** - Two pages is ideal
3. **Poor Formatting** - Use clean, professional formatting
4. **Spelling and Grammar Errors** - Proofread meticulously
5. **Unexplained Gaps** - Briefly explain employment gaps

        content: `## Preparation is Everything

The candidates who succeed in interviews are those who prepare thoroughly. This goes beyond rehearsing answers â€“ it means understanding the company, the role, and how you can add value.

## Research Beyond the Website

- Read recent news about the company
- Check their LinkedIn for culture insights
- Review the interviewer's LinkedIn profile
- Understand competitors and market position
- Look for recent initiatives or challenges

## Prepare Strong STAR Examples

Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure examples:
- **Situation** - Set the context
- **Task** - Explain what needed doing
- **Action** - Describe your specific steps
- **Result** - Highlight the positive outcome

Prepare 5-6 strong examples covering: problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, difficult situations, achieving targets, and handling pressure.

## First Impressions Matter

- Arrive 10-15 minutes early
- Dress appropriately for the company culture
- Greet everyone professionally
- Offer a firm handshake and maintain eye contact
- Switch off your mobile phone
